"""Every API route must be reachable through nginx, or be deliberately listed as origin-only.

The image serves the web player as a static SPA and proxies the streaming API to uvicorn by an
explicit allowlist in docker/nginx-locations.inc. Anything not on that list falls through to
`location /` -> index.html, which returns **200 with HTML** — so a route added to FastAPI and
forgotten here does not 404. It answers, plausibly, with a web page, and the client's `resp.json()`
throws instead.

That is not hypothetical: /subtitleSignature shipped through unit tests, real-uvicorn checks and a
smoke test, and was still unreachable from the bundled player until the hermetic conformance gate
caught `text/html` on :12470. This test turns that verdict into an assertion, so the next route
cannot repeat it.
